Absolutely! Let’s dive into what a **bucket** is in a `HashMap`, and then visualize it.

### ✅ What is a Bucket in HashMap?

In a `HashMap`, the **bucket** is simply a **slot in an internal array** where key-value pairs are stored.

* Internally, `HashMap` uses an **array of buckets**.
* Each bucket holds **entries (key-value pairs)**.
* The position of the bucket is determined using the **hash code** of the key:

  ```java
  bucketIndex = hash(key) & (capacity - 1);
  ```

If **multiple keys** hash to the **same bucket**, they are stored in a **linked list** (or **tree**, if the list gets too long, since Java 8+).

### 📊 Visualizing Buckets (Capacity = 8)

Suppose we create:

```java
Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>(8);
map.put("A", 1);
map.put("B", 2);
map.put("C", 3);
map.put("D", 4);
```

Let’s say (for simplicity) these keys hash as follows:

| Key | `hash(key)` | `bucketIndex = hash & (capacity - 1)` |
| --- | ----------- | ------------------------------------- |
| A   | 42          | 42 & 7 = 2                            |
| B   | 23          | 23 & 7 = 7                            |
| C   | 14          | 14 & 7 = 6                            |
| D   | 42          | 42 & 7 = 2 (collision with A)         |

### 🔍 Buckets Table:

```
Index   | Bucket Content
--------|-------------------------------
0       | [ ]
1       | [ ]
2       | [A:1] → [D:4]  (collision chain)
3       | [ ]
4       | [ ]
5       | [ ]
6       | [C:3]
7       | [B:2]
```

📌 Note:

* Bucket `2` has two entries: **A and D** → this is a **collision** resolved by chaining.
* Buckets can hold 0, 1, or many entries depending on collisions.

### 🧠 Summary

| Term      | Meaning                                                |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Bucket    | Slot in the internal array to store entries            |
| Capacity  | Number of buckets (`default = 16`)                     |
| Collision | When multiple keys map to the same bucket              |
| Chaining  | Handling collisions via linked list/tree in the bucket |

Would you like me to **generate a diagram image** of this bucket table with collisions included?
